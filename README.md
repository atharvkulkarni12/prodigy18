The dataset consists of data of employees and we have to predict if the employee gets promoted.
I defined some new variables. I filled out null values by mean and mode strategies. 
I did label encoding and one-hot-encoding for categorical variables.
Finally I applied XGBoost algorithm to predict target variable for test dataset.
